# iRobot™ Education's Create® 3 is the new Alex Morgan, Mo Salah or Edouard Mendy. 

Design soccer players (that will sit on top of your Create® 3 robot) to shoot a penalty kick or save one and code your Create® 3 robot to fake out the opponent. 

Rules for the shootout are as follow: 
1. Goalkeepers can only move side to side. 
2. Shooters must shoot before taped line.
3. Both teams must press run on their code at the same time. 
4. The ball must be in your contraption before your start the code. 
5. No teleop. 

## Use These Scripts
Either use the Jypter Notebook by:
Navigating from your home directory to the penalty_shootout directory
```
cd ./Tufts_Create3_Examples/penalty_shootout
```
Opening the Jupyter Notebook in a web browser & running the code cell. 
```
jupyter notebook
```

Or use the .py script by:
Moving the script to the example_package folder where the other example_package scripts are located. And adding an entry point to the setup.py file in the package. 

For examples of how to send multiple actions in one script please reference [action_drive_sqaure.py](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/example_package/example_package/action_drive_square.py) and [action_drive_square_2.py](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/example_package/example_package/action_drive_square_2.py).
